I'm Dan, I'm a software developer and general technology oriented person, and a father of 2 amazing little girls. I've a masters in computer science and have worked in the software industry for over 20 years, for most of that as individual contributor and lately as a manager. I've worked on all sorts of stuff from financial systems, front end, embedded software all the way to massive scale web services. I'm not a rockstar pirate ninja coder, but I've learned a few tricks of the trade, and I feel that ultimately I'm a solid journeyman coder and manager that has some advice and insight to share.

Recently I was diagnosed with a rare and incurable type of brain cancer, and while unclear, my prognosis is not generally favorable. Now that I know I have a limited amount time left to me, I'm motivated to share some of what I've learned over the years, in the hope that it will be helpful to others. As I have the time and energy, I will post tidbits. My posts probably be terse and won't be well edited, and will most certainly be completely biased towards my personal preferences but hey, I've got a brain tumor so I can write what I want. I do feel that I should give back what I can to the open source and technology world, becuase it has given me so much in my life.

Oh, and if you are wondering what "Noxemall" is, it was a brand of wheat flour that my grandfather used to make and sell at his feed mill in the small town of Lawrence, MI. It's been a very long time since you could buy it, but I always liked the name and it was unique enough that I decided to use it as my blog name as way to honor my grandfather in a very small way.
