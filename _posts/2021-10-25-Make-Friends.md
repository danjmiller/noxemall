This one is simple, but hard to do for some folks, especially computer oriented folks like myself. It's pretty much kindergarten stuff. Essentially try to be nice to people at work, and if you can, make friends with some of them.

When I was starting out, the common advice was that you have to "network" and that will help your career down the line.  That may be true, but it always felt shallow and self-serving and so I avoided "networking" for the sake of networking (plus I didn't know how). Despite not actively "networking", I managed to connect with co-workers and make some lasting friendships that really have nothing to do with career advancement, and have everything to do with connecting with another person.

I learned that you can make some really good work friends, and they don't have to be your BFF or hang out with you all the time outside of work. Heck you might go long periods without seeing or talking to them, but they'll still be friends and people you can count on if you really need them, even if it's just for some encouraging words or a phone call to BS about the old days. Honestly, it's all about people, and the more people you can call a friend in your life, the better, and where you found those friends doesn't matter one tiny bit in the end.
